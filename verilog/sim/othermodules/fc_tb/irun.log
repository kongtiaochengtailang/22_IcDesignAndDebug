	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	Top level design units:
		fc_tb

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.fc
		worklib.fc_tb
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
ncelab: *W,COVDCL: By default coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators, and for expressions in assignment statements, use the "set_expr_scoring -all" coverage configuration command at elaboration.
